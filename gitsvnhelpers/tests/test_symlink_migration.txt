NOTE: to run this test requires both `svn` and `git` to be on `$PATH`.

Migrating symlinks to full copies
=================================

As of version 0.7 gitify no longer uses symbolic links to create working copies,
but instead uses full copies to avoid conflicts when using the same package in
multiple locations.

If running gitify >= 0.7 on a working copy that has been gitified using a
version < 0.7 we need to raise an explicit warning:

  >>> import os
  >>> from gitsvnhelpers.gitify import gitify
  >>> self.checkout('trunk')

Manually create an old-style symlink to simulate an old-style working copy:

  >>> from gitsvnhelpers.config import GIT_CACHE
  >>> self.shell('ln -s %s%s/.git' % (GIT_CACHE, self.packagename))

Now we run gitify commands and make sure they are *not* executed and that we're 
being warned instead:

  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  ERROR: It seems this working directory has been created with an older version of gitify.
  Please remove the `.git` symlink and re-run gitify to update.
  Aborting.

  >>> gitify(args=['update'])
  ERROR: It seems this working directory has been created with an older version of gitify.
  ...

We remove the offending link and try again as per instructions:

  >>> self.shell('rm .git')
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  No git repository found in...
