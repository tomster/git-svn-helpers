NOTE: to run this test requires both `svn` and `git` to be on `$PATH`.

Running fetch
=============

The fetch updates all or some of the local cashes. It is primarily intended
to be run as a maintenance command, i.e. via crontab to keep local copies 'fresh'.

First we create a checkout. This creates an entry of the testpackage in the cache.

  >>> import os
  >>> from gitsvnhelpers.gitify import gitify
  >>> self.checkout('trunk')
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  No git repository found in...
  Initiating cloning into cache.
  Analyzing svn log...
  Cloning file:///...
  Initialized empty Git repository in ...
  ...
  Git branch 'local/trunk' is now following svn branch 'trunk':
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

If we run without parameters, it will try to fetch all, in this case, the only one.
The fetch command does not depend on being run inside a working copy, so we change out of, first:

  >>> os.chdir(self.tempdir)
  >>> gitify(args=['fetch'])
  fetching .../.gitcache/testpackage
  Done. 1 packages updated.

TODO: test with multiple repos. However, that's just simple globbing, so no
high priority.
